# 2015 GSL Season 2

## Round of 16

With Group H finishing on the 20th, the round of 16 for GSL Season 2 is set. I'll provide my predictions on who will make it to the round of 8.


The round of 16 has:

Rain
GuMiho
MyuNgSik
Fantasy
Rouge
Bomber
INnoVation
Maru
ByuL
Bbyong
Life
herO (cj entus)
Dream
MMA(assumed)
Curious(assumed)


A lot of the round of 8 will depend on the group selection phase. Still, we can predict the top players of this group of sixteen. We're looking at a ton of terrans in this round of 16 and a lot less zerg. Prevaling wisdom says that zerg is displaced because of recent swarm host changes. However, the swarm host is mostly used it ZvP and we see more terrans than protoss heading into the round of 16.

Three of my favorites to win the entire gsl are INnoVation, Life, and PartinG. Interestingly, all of those players lost a match in the round of 32. They had to fight their way back through the final match to earn their spot.

In group C, FanTaSy was on point. Decisively taking down soO and Rouge makes him terrifying to zergs in the round of 16. However, any Zerg that knows FanTaSy is coming will have plenty of vods to watch for research. FanTaSy also showed well in Kespa against Zest.


The team to watch in my mind is Sbenu (formerly StarTale). Performances in the round of 32 by MyuNgSik and Bomber were above expectations. MyuNgSik taking out PartinG in PvP was unexpected. That group saw PartinG take down Dark in the final match, further pushing down the Zerg representation in the round of 16. I am looking forward to Curious' showing in the final group of the round of 16. I expect MMA and Curious to get out of that group. MMA made it to the Ro4 in Season 2, before being destroyed 4-1 by PartinG.

# Round of 8 Predictions


Life is an obvious choice based on his history and performance.
PartinG won IEM recently and is playing well, should be able to make Ro4 at least.

herO and INnoVation are my #3 and #4 seeds into Ro16.

I think MyuNgSiK is going to go deep this season and should make it into Ro8.

Maru is always a safe choice, though he lost more games in Ro32 than he should have, notably to TY. We may be headed back into GomTvT territory, and performance later this season will be driven by a players competency against terran. More on that later.
I like Rouge for Ro8 as well, this will depend what other heavies he gets paired with. His ZvT is on point (63% according to aligulac).
I think the final player in the Ro8 will be a terran: either FanTaSy or Bomber. This will also come down to grouping, I think Bomber beating INnoVation in Group D was a fluke, and that INnoVation is a more solid player.


# Win rate vs Terran

Anyone making it to the Ro8 in this GSL season is gonna do it by walking over a lot of terran bodies. Let's look at the win rate vs terran for each of my picks(all stats from Aligulac):

Life: 61.3%
PartinG: 67.5%
INnoVation: 65.7%
MyuNgSik: 49.0%
herO: 63.9%
Maru: 63.0%
FanTaSy: 61.3%
Bomber: 62.4%


For the Ro4/Finals I can see rematches between Life/herO or Life/PartinG. Life is able to make Roach/Hydra/Blinding Cloud work against protoss and we will see if PartinG and herO have an answer for that.

Note that MyuNgSik, whose performance in the Ro32 was surprising, has a win rate vs terran far below these others.

I am so pumped for this GSL season. Now if only I could understand what happens during the group selection game-show thing.
